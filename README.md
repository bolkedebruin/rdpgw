RDPGW is an implementation of the [Remote Desktop Gateway protocol](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-tsgu/0007d661-a86d-4e8f-89f7-7f77f8824188).
This allows you to connect with the official Microsoft clients to remote desktops over HTTPS. 
These desktops could be, for example, [XRDP](http://www.xrdp.org) desktops running in containers
on Kubernetes.

## AIM
RDPGW aims to provide a full open source replacement for MS Remote Desktop Gateway, 
including access policies.

## Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)
RDPGW provides multi factor authentication out of the box with OpenID Connect integration. Thus
you can integrate your remote desktops with Keycloak, Okta, Google, Azure, Apple or Facebook 
if you want. 

## Security

__NOTE__: rdogw now supports PAM authentication as well if you configure it to use 'local' authentication. Further documentation pending.

RDPGW wants to be secure when you set it up from the beginning. It does this by having OpenID
Connect integration enabled by default. Cookies are encrypted and signed on the client side relying
on [Gorilla Sessions](https://www.gorillatoolkit.org/pkg/sessions). PAA tokens (gateway access tokens)
are generated and signed according to the JWT spec by using [jwt-go](https://github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go)
signed with a 256 bit HMAC. Hosts provided by the user are verified against what was provided by
the server. Finally, the client's ip address needs to match the one it obtained the token with.

## How to build & install

__NOTE__: a docker image is available on docker hub, which removes the need for building and installing go.

Ensure that you have `make` (comes with standard build tools, like `build-essential` on Debian), `go` (version 1.19 or above), and development files for PAM (`libpam0g-dev` on Debian) installed.

Then clone the repo and issues the following.

```bash
cd rdpgw
make
make install
```

## Configuration
By default the configuration is read from `rdpgw.yaml`. Below is a 
template.

```yaml
# web server configuration. 
Server:
 # can be set to openid, kerberos and local. If openid is used rdpgw expects
 # a configured openid provider, make sure to set caps.tokenauth to true. If local
 # rdpgw connects to rdpgw-auth over a socket to verify users and password. Note:
 # rdpgw-auth needs to be run as root or setuid in order to work. If kerberos is
 # used a keytab and krb5conf need to be supplied. local and kerberos authentication
 # can be stacked, so that the clients selects what it wants.
 Authentication: 
  - openid
 # The socket to connect to if using local auth. Ensure rdpgw auth is configured to
 # use the same socket.
 AuthSocket: /tmp/rdpgw-auth.sock
 # Basic auth timeout (in seconds). Useful if you're planning on waiting for MFA
 BasicAuthTimeout: 5
 # The default option 'auto' uses a certificate file if provided and found otherwise
 # it uses letsencrypt to obtain a certificate, the latter requires that the host is reachable
 # from letsencrypt servers. If TLS termination happens somewhere else (e.g. a load balancer)
 # set this option to 'disable'. This is mutually exclusive with 'authentication: local'
 # Note: rdp connections over a gateway require TLS
 Tls: auto
 # TLS certificate files
 CertFile: server.pem
 KeyFile: key.pem
 # gateway address advertised in the rdp files and browser
 GatewayAddress: localhost
 # port to listen on (change to 80 or equivalent if not using TLS)
 Port: 443
 # list of acceptable desktop hosts to connect to
 Hosts:
  - localhost:3389
  - my-{{ preferred_username }}-host:3389
 # if true the server randomly selects a host to connect to
 # valid options are: 
 #  - roundrobin, which selects a random host from the list (default)
 #  - signed, a listed host specified in the signed query parameter
 #  - unsigned, a listed host specified in the query parameter
 #  - any, insecurely allow any host specified in the query parameter
 HostSelection: roundrobin 
 # a random strings of at least 32 characters to secure cookies on the client
 # make sure to share this across the different pods

  # where to store session details. This can be either file or cookie (default: cookie)
  # if a file store is chosen, it is required to have clients 'keep state' to the rdpgw
  # instance they are connected to.

  EnableUserToken: true

  # connection is opened.
  VerifyClientIp: true
```
## Testing locally
A convenience docker-compose allows you to test the RDPGW locally. It uses [Keycloak](http://www.keycloak.org) 
and [xrdp](http://www.xrdp.org) and exposes it services on port 443. You will need to allow your browser
to connect to localhost with and self signed security certificate. For chrome set `chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost`.
The username to login to both Keycloak and xrdp is `admin` as is the password.

```bash
cd dev/docker
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

## Use
Point your browser to `https://your-gateway/connect`. After authentication
and RDP file will download to your desktop. This file can be opened by one
of the remote desktop clients and it will try to connect to the gateway and
desktop host behind it.

## Integration
The gateway exposes an endpoint for the verification of user tokens at
https://yourserver/tokeninfo . The query parameter is 'access_token' so
you can just do a GET to https://yourserver/tokeninfo?access_token=<token> .
It will return 200 OK with the decrypted token.

In this way you can integrate, for example, it with [pam-jwt](https://github.com/bolkedebruin/pam-jwt).

## TODO
* Integrate Open Policy Agent
* Integrate uber-go/zap
* Research: TLS defragmentation 
* Improve Web Interface
